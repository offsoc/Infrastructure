Requested account name. Please note nicknames are NOT allowed (https://wiki.gnome.org/AccountsTeam/AccountNamePolicy)

Explanation why you think you should get an account

Also attach to the issue (do not paste inline!) the public part of your passphrase protected SSH version 2 key pair (usually ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub). 

Note: We require RSA (4096 preferred). Use ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096. Please make sure your key matches all the requirements listed at
https://wiki.gnome.org/AccountsTeam/SSHKeyGuidelines. If your key does not match all requirements, it will not be possible to use it, and
your accounts application will be significantly delayed.
