### Account details

Please provide the following information:

1. Your full name
2. Permanent email address
3. Requested account name. Please note nicknames are NOT allowed (https://wiki.gnome.org/AccountsTeam/AccountNamePolicy)
4. Explanation why you think you should get an account
5. Attach (do not paste inline!) the public part of your passphrase protected SSH version 2 key pair (usually ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub). 

Note: We require RSA (4096 preferred). Use `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`. Please make sure your key matches all the requirements listed at
